# Backend Service

This directory is reserved for the backend API and services.

Currently, the application logic resides primarily in the `frontend` directory (Next.js API routes or client-side logic).

## Future Setup
1.  Initialize a backend project (Node.js, Python, etc.).
2.  Configure database connections.
3.  Set up API endpoints.
